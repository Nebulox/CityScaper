  "description" : "Hello again my not-so-loyal subscribers! I present, the CITYSCAPER!\n\nIf you can't use the steam version, use [url=https://github.com/Nebulox/CityScaper]the Github version here![/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/2958989874]See change notes here![/url]\n[b]TLDR:[/b] Latest update completely overhauls the mod and UI, updates basically all structures to be cleaner, and fixes the monsters spawning in rooms. Can also use admin to get it free now.\nOld addons still work!\n\n[h1]PLEASE NOTE:[/h1]\nThis mod is NOT clientside, if you wish to play with this content with a friend or on a server, both you and your friend or server must also be subscribed to this mod.\nIt IS compatible with FU and Elithian Races Mod and every other damn mod out there... stop asking.\n\n[h1]To build, or not to build!:[/h1]\nA blueprint, accessible via the Planner interface.\nYou can access this interface via [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1088459034]Quickbar[/url] or with a Planning Bench. crafted at the inventors table, and it looks like an inventors table but rotated and with some metal attachments.\n\nThe blueprint can be used to place a dungeon with left click, and can reopen the Planner interface with right click.\nWhile held, the blueprint will preview the dungeon at the cursor.\n\nThe planner interface has modules, and 3 different tabs; Room, Prefab and Dungeon.\nRooms are single room-style well rooms. These are intended to be placed next to and on eachother to build housing.\nPrefabs are fully built houses, and small dungeons, they also include larger chunks of rooms that can be connected, such as the peacekeeper space station.\nDungeons are things like the Avian Airship, massive dungeons and are generally very expensive to build.\n\nModules represent the mod the content is from, patches should add their own.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2958989874/597396108583377769/]This guide should cover everything you need to know![/url]\n\n[h1]Addons:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3093874669]Alcoholic Poptops[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3357162344]Deerfolk Unbound[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959258398]Saturnians[/url]\n\n[h1]Plans:[/h1]\n- More stuff more content\n- More everything!\n- Some addons\n- Maybe some better organisation\n- Probably more standardisation of rooms, e.g. peacekeeper is a diff size to the outpost ones\n- More room types\n\n[h1]Credits:[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nebuloxxx]Neb[/url]: The placement system, the interface, the graphics and general designs. Implemented the dungeons and also prepared a patch template. And the entire rework of the mod.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TeaLovingLad/]Tea-Loving Lad[/url]: Drew the blueprint sprite for the item, and drew the thumbnail on short notice, literal mad [i]tea-loving[/i] lad.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199098507120]Pikachu[/url]: For commissioning this mod and being incredibly patient waiting for my studies and work and letting me work at my own pace. Thanks!\n\"Sir Arthur the Crusader\": For commissioning the peacekeeper content for cityscaper, which motivated me to finish the rework for the whole mod!\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverSokolova]Silver Sokolova[/url]: Helped with the search bar feature on the UI and other small tweaks.\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077652646]Monica[/url]: Creating the house and bridge prefabs.\n\n[h1]Extras:[/h1]\nI also have a guide for modding starbound, useful for beginners and veterans! Check it out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2574693146]here![/url]\n\nI am not as activate anymore due to life and limitations to modding, where my time can be more valuably spent elsewhere, however you can still find me here, just ping me in these servers to get my attention.\nMy [url=https://discord.gg/t/mkWruEK]Discord Server[/url]\nThe [url=https://discord.gg/uzFUnT5uDQ]Starforge server[/url]\n\nYou can support me at [url=https://www.patreon.com/Nebulox]Patreon[/url], buy me a [url=https://ko-fi.com/nebulox]Ko-fi[/url] or just give me [url=https://paypal.me/nebuloxxx]money at PayPal[/url]. Since I am a student at university and I am also employed, my time is scarce, so all modding efforts go towards commissions, and paid content. Given rough circumstances, anything goes a long way and lets me work on content for this game again!\n[url=https://www.patreon.com/Nebulox][img]https://i.imgur.com/CZWCYI0.gif[/img][/url][url=https://ko-fi.com/nebulox][img]https://i.imgur.com/No2cfjS.gif[/img][/url][url=https://paypal.me/nebuloxxx][img]https://i.imgur.com/Us65r3s.gif[/img][/url]\n\n[h1]Updates?[/h1]\nYo!
